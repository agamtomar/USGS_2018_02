# Advanced Point-to-Point Communication: Exercise 3

Consider the program ex3.{f90,cpp, py, R}.  

This program is a working solution to the earlier, point-to-point, AllReduce exercise.   Its AllReduce algorithm is presently written using blocking sends and receives.   Rewrite the program using non-blocking sends and receives.

Solutions in each language are provided in their respective language directories.
