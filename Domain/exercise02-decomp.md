# Domain Decomposition Exercise and Collective Communication

Modify the code `mpi_collatz.{f90, cpp, py, R}` in the `Examples` so that it reports the number with the largest collatz sequence length, and its length, occuring in the interval [1, N Million] where N is the number of MPI ranks.

See the comments in the program to add collective communication
