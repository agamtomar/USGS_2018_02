# Overlapping Communication and Computation

Modiy the program `grid_decomposition` so that the work is overlapping with the communication.

Hint: Start the work around the boundaries of the domain, so that once that work is completed you can start exchanging the boundary values and then continue the work in the interior of the domain.
